  <p>WELCOME TO OUR SITE!</p>
  <p>On behalf of the members of Alpha Omega Epsilon Beta Lambda Chapter at Lehigh, welcome! Here you can find some
    information about who we are and what we do. Feel free to look around and reach out to a.o.e.lehigh@gmail.com with
    any questions or comments.</p>

  <p>Our Chapter at Lehigh University was founded just a few years ago. Though we are relatively new, we currently boast
    about 40 sisters who strive to promote
    friendship, leadership, and professionalism. We are a Professional and Social Engineering and Technical Science
    Sorority, though you do not need to be in a specific major to join us. A.O.E. offers leadership opportunities,
    chances to meet lifelong friends, and the ability to develop yourself professionally in your field of study. We
    strive to be a positive addition to the campus and Bethlehem communities. Our development and success as a chapter
    relies on the wonderful young women we welcome to our organization every semester. We would love to have you join us
    during your undergraduate career at Lehigh.</p>

  <p> Again, feel free to reach out with any questions!</p>
