    <p>Candidacy! 6 weeks, 9 candidates, tons of memories.</p>

    <p>One of the highlights of candidacy is our sister retreat. This is one of the biggest
      events where the sisters and candidates really get to bond. We spend the whole day together to reconnect
      and get to know more about each other. This year we went to the Lost River Caverns where we toured an underground
      wonderland.
      The most anticipated event is the Big/Little reveal, where the candidates discover who their bigs are! To end the
      night,
      we participated in an emotional activity that strengthens our bond with each other. </p>

    <p>Topping it off is Initiation where we welcomed 9 girls into our sorority as they transitioned from candidates to
      sisters!</p>
