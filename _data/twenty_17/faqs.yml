- question: "I'm interested! How do I join?"
  answer: "We hold recruitment events at the beginning of the every semester, unless we are doing a sisterhood semester in which we will not be recruiting. Otherwise, we will be at the club 
  fair where you can sign up for more information. There will be events that you will go to to learn more about AOE, get to know the sisters, and at the end, be invited to Pref Night and  
  potentailly get a bid!"

- question: "What majors do you accept?"
  answer: "All majors! Whether you're an engineer or scientist like most of us or if you're in the school of business, we welcome all females to join."

- question: "Is there a house on the hill?"
  answer: "Nope. Since we're not part of the panhellenic council, we do not have a house. A lot of sisters do choose to live with each other on campus or off campus, though!"

- question: "Can I be in both AOE and PSP?"
  answer: "Unfortunately, no. You cannot join if you are already in PSP, APO, or any house on the hill."
